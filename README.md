# Color-Picker

This is a program to help user create or select a suitable color harmony for their needs. All they have to do is pick a color that they want and the algorithm will show them each color harmonies! I plan to add more after I experiment or see more color harmonies.

Isn't that cool? 

Feel free to contribute to this! I would love to hear your thoughts on this too! 

im still configuring my server to ensure this works, this will be updated once it works! Come back in prob a few weeks!
